## Code Overview

- The existing code for this assignment was functional, but riddled with repetition and non-descriptive html elements that were certainly not going to assist in SEO (search engine optimization), a major priority in today's web development industry. The CSS was also riddled with duplication and therefore made the CSS unnecesarily large.

## HTML

- My first priority was to place the html code in semantic structure as it was simplay placed in non-descript div's. This wouldn't allow a search engine to accurately assess the content of the html structure. Placing the html in semantic structure creates a logical flow and indicates to the search engine that this pages has distinct parts which when put together, create a more accessible and complete user experience.

## CSS style

- I was able to reduce the CSS from over 200 lines of code to about half that. I believe further reductions in CSS are possible but the more I tried to reduce it, the more problems were caused in the appearance on the webpage. The CSS as is, represents a much more efficient and scaled down product in line with the Scout Principal and the DRY concept (Do not repeat yourself). Review with an instructor or fellow coder, I'm sure, could see a further reduction in CSS lines. However, the CSS as is represents where I currently am with my CSS knowledge.
